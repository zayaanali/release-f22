 * A 'valid schedule' should assign each course to a timeslot in such a way that there are no conflicts for exams
 * In other words, two courses who share a student should not share an exam time.
 * Your solution should try to minimize the total number of timeslots but should not exceed the timeslots given.
 * 
 * The output V2D should have one row for each timeslot, even if that timeslot is not used.
 * 
 * As the problem is NP-complete, your first scheduling might not result in a valid match. Your solution should 
 * continue to attempt different schedulings until 1) a valid scheduling is found or 2) you have exhausted all possible
 * starting positions. If no match is possible, return a V2D with one row with the string '-1' as the only value.
